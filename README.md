This is my first app that is on the App Store. 

It is about a simple pen and pencil game that is very famous among young people. 
We are jumping back in the game of Tic Tac Toe, but with a new and fresh approach, that you will surely not expect.

Tria Tactics is a game of three moves, and the offline version has been developed, tested, debugged and pushed on the App Store in 6 days. 

I was not satisfied with the result and therefore implemented the GameKit framework to allow online games through game center.

As per now, the app is going through the App Store review to push the next update. The code is still a work in progress in the debugging, refactoring, and scalability area.
